ShoeCo Inc., a shoe manufacturer, wants to understand if their newest shoe, the RunPro 3000, makes runners faster. In order to do so, they convinced a nearby marathon to provide 50% of runners with a free pair of RunPro 3000s as long as they wore them during the race. ShoeCo Inc. has now asked you to analyze their data and see if the shoes actually made a difference.

Attached are two csv files and below are the file names and fields included therein:

**runner_attributes.csv**

- ageClass: The decade corresponding to the runner’s age (e.g., 20, 30, 40)
- sex: The runner’s gender
- nationality: A 3-letter code corresponding to the runner’s nationality
- treatment: Whether the runner was given the RunPro 3000s (Treatment) or not
- (Control) unique_id: The runner’s unique ID

**marathon_times.csv**

- netTime: The number of seconds seconds between the runner’s race start and race finish
- clockTime: The marathon clock time (since the beginning of the race) at the time of the runner’s race finish

Please use the attached data and let ShoeCo Inc. know whether or not the RunPro 3000s actually had a statistically significant impact on runner performance. If so, is the impact on performance the same for all runners? If not, how does the impact of the shoes vary as a function of the runner’s attributes. Can you use the runner’s attributes (including whether or not they are wearing RunPro 3000s) to predict how quickly they will finish the marathon?

Please write up your results and send them in, along with any code, excel spreadsheets, etc. that you used to achieve your results. Try to explain your results as well as you can with plain english, equations, and data visualizations. Spend no more than 8 hours on this take home assignment!
